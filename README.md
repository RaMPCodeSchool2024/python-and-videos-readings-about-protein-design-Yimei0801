# HW4


## Objectives for this assignment:
* Write a Python program to satisfy a set of requirements in five separate problems
* Get acquainted with proteins and computional protein design by watching/reading the assigned videos/readings and editing this README.md file to answer the corresponding prompts
* Turn in homework assignment

This assignment attempts to build on the skills you learned in the previous assignment. There are five Python challenges for you to complete. Each requires you to implement code from scratch (looking up built-in functions and syntax is always encouraged).


## Problem 0, 1, 2, 3, and 3.5

You will complete these coding challenges in the same notebook called homework4.ipynb. This notebook has a set of instructions for you to follow.

* [ ] Complete the `homework4.ipynb` notebook

## Turn in homework assignment

You will need to upload your completed notebook to your GitHub repository. To complete the assignment, you have made changes to the file `homework4.ipynb`.  Please delete the old version of the notebook and then upload the new version so that there are no duplicates.

Now you need to commit and push your changes to your repository. You can do this by following the instructions in the GitHub tutorial from HW1. 

* [ ] Commit and push your changes to your repository

## Final notes

Your first instinct should be to ask your peers for help using the Slack channel. No need to be shy! Let's keep Marissa's DMs free for important things like cat pictures and memes.

You are encouraged to reach out to your peers and the teaching team while working through this assignment. You can use the Slack channel to ask questions and discuss the homework. Thoroughly read through the assignment and attempt to complete it on your own before asking for help. When asking for help, be sure to include all relevant details and a screenshot of any error messages you are receiving (if applicable). 

## Answer key

The answer key for this assignment will be posted after the due date for the assignment has passed.
